title: goodbye linkedin
---

i've decided to delete my linkedin account. in fact next month marks the 6th month since i deleted my linkedin account. i haven't found myself in search for a job just yet and i promise to update this blog once i do, but it seems that so far nothing of value was lost. if anything, i have now one less feed to doomscroll in my life :)

and it's not just about linkedin although it does seem that [most content there has that disingenuous vibe](https://x.com/Chesschick01/status/1860069605760495781).

## what about the others?

i still have an instagram account, a facebook account, a hackernews account and an x account. instagram is my source of memes and a way to signal loved ones living abroad that i am still here, i've considered deleting that a couple times in the past and i'll probably consider it again in six months time. hackernews and x are the apps i use to follow the latest in tech, society and the rare but [delightful philosophical shitposting](https://x.com/Andercot/status/1860227833064517886).

facebook is the one account i've had the longest and it remains the hardest one to let go of, first it was the depedency on their messenger app which i successfully dropped in favour of the other zuck-owned messenger app. then it was the social/memes-shaped hole that later got replaced with the other zuck-owned social/memes app. hopefully meta will soon release standalone apps for marketplace and groups!
